This is one of the final problems of the online course ["How to Code: Complex Data"](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-complex-data-ubcx-htc2x) by Gregor Kiczales (University of British Columbia).

The core program is a function that takes a user in a social network ("Chirper") and produces the user in their network who is followed by the most users in that self-contained network.

The program is run in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/download/).

All code my own, since the base file included no constants, data definitions, nor functions. Unfortunately, I did not track changes on GitHub while building the project, which is why the first commit is the completed project.

The core purpose of this project was to practice using fundamentals taught by the course; in this case, working with a cyclic arbitrary-arity tree (i.e., a graph). This particular function demonstrates knowledge of mutually recursive functions, encapsulation with local functions, abstract higher-order functions, and accumulators.
